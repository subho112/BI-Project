Sector Analysis: Charts displaying the performance of different sectors (e.g., technology, healthcare, finance) to identify which sectors are performing well.

Individual Stock Performance: Detailed views of specific stocks, including price trends, volume, and key financial metrics (e.g., P/E ratio, market capitalization).
